### Summary  
This week, we went over three essays that took a close look at the hegemonic forces at play in a writing center. Last week focused on the objectives and theoretical purpose of a writing center while the authors of the essays above evaluate environmental properties of a writing center. Ethnicity and its relationship with the neutral standards of “the Queen's English” is seen as a point of contention that places constraints on identity, which goes against the idea of writing centers being a place to draw-out self-expression. They believe that students visiting writing centers are from different backgrounds and should be treated as equally qualified to express such differences without being seen as mechanically insufficient. If this is achieved, then students will become better writers because their work will be seen as a reflection of the writer and not the standard.  

### Comment
 I enjoyed this portion of readings and class discussions because it was very philosophical. I wrote an essay last semester about _Communication as Impression_ and how all interactions are just reactions to observations and internalized through perceptions generated by previous reactions to observations. I always enjoy people trying to deconstruct standardized notions.  

### Question
If I wrote my next blog in French, which is part of my list of identities, how would you assess it. One could have a French speaker assess it or google translate it. I feel like the translated version would best reflect how the person would mentally perceive the language and could be a control sample for an EaSL person.
